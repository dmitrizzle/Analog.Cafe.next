        <h3>Submissions</h3>
        <p>
          <em>
            By sending a <Link to="/submit">submission</Link>, using Analog.Cafe
            website and the <Link to={"/submit/compose"}>Composer</Link> tool,
            you are agreeing to the following rules:
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who submits text, format, and images for publication on
          Analog.Cafe, using the above-mentioned Composer tool and submission
          page will be referred to here as an Author. Format is a layout of the
          submission work (links, highlights, quotes, how the images arranged,
          etc.) “Work” and “submission” are used interchangeably, meaning the
          same thing: uploading the text, format, and images to Analog.Cafe
          owned and/or rented servers. Editor(s) are the people or person who
          have provided edits to the submission and have the right and capacity
          to publish the work on Analog.Cafe website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authors retain the complete copyright of their work. By submitting
          their work they give Analog.Cafe the right to exhibit it in accordance
          to the terms listed below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Release & Withdrawal.</strong> By submitting text, format, and
          images work Authors give Analog.Cafe full, non-exclusive permission to
          exhibit it online on this website and any other location representing
          this website (such as social accounts, other websites offline printed
          and display medium etc). Authors’ work may be included (same general
          function as “retweeting” on Twitter or “sharing” on Facebook or any
          other social network) within other Authors’ submissions with a link to
          the first Author’s profile on Analog.Cafe when clicked on an image and
          in the title of the post. Authors are giving Analog.Cafe and the
          Authors of Analog.Cafe the right to use their work in such manner
          (Analog.Cafe will make reasonable effort to ensure that all of such
          actions are respectful and in good faith, up to discretion of
          Analog.Cafe editors). Authors are also granting Analog.Cafe Editors
          the permission to modify the submissions (cropping, colour and quality
          adjustments as well as copy editing and visual decorations). Authors
          are free to request an immediate withdrawal of the work at any time
          via email (see <Link to="/about">About</Link> page for contact info).
          We will comply as soon as possible or within two weeks of request;
          images which are used within other posts or are “suggested” images
          will take longer to remove (up to 30 days), since we’ll be forced to
          make arrangements that would satisfy all the Authors and Editors who
          have used that material. Analog.Cafe also reserves the right to remove
          Authors’ work at any time at Editors’ discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exclusivity.</strong> Authors’ work is being exhibited on a
          non-exclusive basis, unless otherwise specified. This means that you
          are free to continue submitting it to any other gallery or website
          that you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Watermarks.</strong> If an Author chooses to place watermarks
          on images, their aesthetics will be considered by Analog.Cafe Editor.
          Meaning that tasteful, well-designed (this is up to Analog.Cafe
          Editor’s discretion) watermarks may be acceptable; badly-designed,
          obstructive (this is up to Analog.Cafe Editor’s discretion) watermarks
          might diminish Authors’ works’ chances to be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Admission.</strong> There are no submission fees and no
          monetary compensation to the person submitting unless otherwise
          specified. Analog.Cafe editors select and publish submissions that
          they feel are a good fit – and reserve the right to decline any and
          all submissions. Analog.Cafe gives no guarantee or promise of any kind
          that a submission will be accepted, kept, or published.
        </p>
        <p>
          All copy-editing and touch-up work is done at Analog.Cafe Editors’
          discretion. Analog.Cafe may or may not accept Authors’ edit requests;
          all edits are done for the benefit of a good overall presentation of
          the whole magazine, rather than just one piece. Analog.Cafe staff has
          limited time and resources, please keep that in mind when making
          requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submissions which have not been accepted are subject to being deleted
          from our servers within a month of such decision. This is a manual
          action and isn’t a rule or a guarantee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spam and any submissions deemed unacceptible or inappropriate are
          subject to immediate deletion and the Author’s account is a subject to
          suspension or banning.
        </p>
