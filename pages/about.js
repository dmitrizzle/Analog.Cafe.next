            <p>
              This project began in 2017 as an idea for a community publishing
              platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Analog.Cafe got funded via Kickstarter on May 5<sup>th</sup>. The

              My wife, <Link to="/u/betty">Betty</Link>, has been a tremendous
              help in setting the tone, quality, and consistency of the
              articles. None of this would make sense without her help and the
              fantastic people who supported me along this journey.

              Almost every image on this website is shot on film. There could be{" "}
