          This project budded in 2017 as an idea for a community publishing

          Analog.Cafe got funded via Kickstarter on May 5<sup>th</sup>. The

          My wife, <Link to="/u/betty">Betty</Link>, has been a tremendous help
          in setting the tone, quality, and consistency of the articles. None of

          Almost every image on this website is shot on film. There could be a

          comes with a unique look, process, and memories.{" "}
