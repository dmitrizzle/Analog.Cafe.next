      <strong>How much does 35mm film cost?</strong> Shopping for new film can
      be challenging. Especially if it’s something new and you are looking to
      get a good deal. Sticker prices for the fresh stock can range anywhere
      between two and a hundred dollars per roll. And there’re plenty of choices
      to get lost in.

      There is no simple logic to this either. Amazon, for example, sells lots
      of film but the deals aren’t good unless you buy in palettes.
