    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Film Prices</strong> is a searchable database of popular 35mm film
      stocks with samples, prices ($, €, £, ¥, ฿), and mini-reviews. Use this
      web app to save money and get better results from your 35mm film
      photography.
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve been maintaining this database of popular 35mm film prices, samples,
      and mini-reviews since 2018. This app has helped many people, including
      myself, understand what a “fair”/market/average price of a film is and
      what kind of result to expect from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, search for your film stock and click on it for more
      details, review, and sample images.
