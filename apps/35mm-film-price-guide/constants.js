Initially backed with black sticky stuff called rem-jet, this film has been modified by “The Brothers Wright,” founders of SineStill, to be ready for development in regular C-41 chemistry. The purpose of rem-jet is to filter out halation – red halos around bright objects that form when the light reflects from the pressure plate back into the medium. By having it removed, the resulting emulsion produces unique colour effects, particularly noticeable on dark backgrounds. The halation effect is present to some degree in all films; however, CineStill 800T creates the most pronounced visuals. The “T” stands for the tungsten-balanced colour palette, meant to look natural in yellow light common for indoor lighting; in the daytime, the emulsion produces a teal colour shift. This film can be push-processed up to 3200ISO.",
